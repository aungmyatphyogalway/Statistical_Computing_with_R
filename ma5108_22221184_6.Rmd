##(1) pchisq(q,df,ncp=0, lower.tail= TRUE, log.p= FALSE)

#q means for quantiles vector

#df means degree of freedom and it can be calculated from (number of rows in contingency table -1 x number of columns in the table - 1 )

#ncp means non central parameter (not negative)

#when lower.tail= TRUE, probabilities are P(X<=x), and on the other side,P(X>x)

#if log.p is false, probabilities are not given as log(p)

#according to p-value 2.2e-16, it rejects the null hypothesis  that experimental data is consistent with no bias in actual retroviral insertion sites between exon and non_exon regions within genes at very significant level.
