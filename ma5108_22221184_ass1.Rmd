## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



patientID

    A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2

CEA

    35,2.1,8,15,0.3,4.2

S100_A9

    378.5, 28.2, 48.1, 138.8, 0.2, 1.4

Each question is worth 1 mark.

    Create vectors for each variable - use sensible variable names of your own choice (hint: remember that some of these are lists of numbers, whilst others are lists of characters)
```{r}    
patientID<- c("A1","A2","B1","B2","C1","C2")
CEA<- c(35,2.1,8,15,0.3,4.2)
S100_A9<- c(378.5,28.2,48.1,138.8,0.2,1.4)
```
    
    

    Create a new vector having converted the S100_A9 to log10 format (hint: to the base 10 - look up the function log10() using the R help facility)
```{r}    
log10vS100_A9<-log10(S100_A9)
log10vS100_A9
```
    
    Combine the three vectors (using the log10 version for S100_A9) into a dataframe called exosome_study_df with the following column headers: ID, Antigen, Protein - view the contents of the dataframe to satisfy yourself that it has worked
```{r}    
exosome_study_df<-data.frame(ID=patientID,Antigen=CEA,Protein=log10vS100_A9)
View(exosome_study_df)
```
   
   
    Use the nrow() and ncol() commands to determine the number of rows and columns in this dataframe, and finally the dim() command to get both of these together.
```{r}
nrow(exosome_study_df)
ncol(exosome_study_df)
dim(exosome_study_df)
```


    Extract the column corresponding to the column header Antigen
```{r}
exosome_study_df["Antigen"]
```

    Extract the column corresponding to the column header Protein and convert this from log10 back to it's normal values, place this output in a new vector variable Protein_normal (hint: remember that to go from `log10' back to the original number you need to raise the log10 value to the power 10)
```{r}
exosome_study_df["Protein"]
Proein_normal<-10^exosome_study_df$Protein
Proein_normal
```
    

    Extract the row corresponding to the row with the patient ID B2
```{r}
exosome_study_df[4,]
```
    The R commands min(), mean(), and max() generate the minimum, maximum and mean values in a vector (or column). Use these commands to find out the min, max and mean of the columns Antigen and Protein
```{r}
min(exosome_study_df$Antigen)
max(exosome_study_df$Antigen)
mean(exosome_study_df$Antigen)
min(exosome_study_df$Protein)
max(exosome_study_df$Protein)
mean(exosome_study_df$Protein)
```
